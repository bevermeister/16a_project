16A Final Project - VORDLE
Group Members: Aubrey Gilman, Annaka Schone, and Uno Thurfjell

VORDLE is our own version of the popular online game Wordle, except renamed to ‘VORDLE” to pay homage to our TA, Vishnu! The basic concept of the game is that there is a random five-letter word in the system, and you have six tries to figure out the correct word. Similar concept to Mastermind, with every guess you make, the game will tell you if each letter is correct and in the right spot, correct and in the wrong spot, or incorrect and not in the word, allowing the player to deduce what the word might be. It includes extra features in contrast to the original game, including background music, a timer, and other fun add-ons!

For this project, we installed the Pygame package in order to develop the game.

Requirements:
Project name.
Names of group members (if you don’t want to for privacy, add usernames).
Short description of the project.
Instructions on how to install the package requirements. If you used the conda line above, your instruction should have the line conda create --name NEWENV --file requirements.txt.
Detailed description of the demo file. This includes detailed instructions on how to run it, what output one should expect to see, and any explanations or interpretations of the result. There should be at least 2 figures embedded in this section. It can be screenshots of your game, or plots generated by your data visualization code. Make sure these figures have appropriate titles and captions, and are sufficiently explained in your text.
Scope and limitations, including ethical implications, accessibility concerns, and ideas for potential extensions.
License and terms of use (probably MIT license).
References and acknowledgement.
(If appropriate) background and source of the dataset.
(If appropriate) links to any tutorials you used, and at least 3 specific things you implemented that differentiates your project from what’s already in the tutorial.
